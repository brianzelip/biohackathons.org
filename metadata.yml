- about:
    - title: Goal
      text: Bringing people together to build tools to or perform advanced bioinformatics analysis.
    - title: Products
      text: Some pipelines and other scripts, software and programs generated in the events will be added to public GitHub repositories designed for that purpose.\r\nA manuscript outlining the design and usage of the software tools constructed by each team may be submitted to an appropriate journal, such as the F1000Research Hackathons channel.
    - title: Notes
      text: Typically, participants will need to bring their own laptop to these programs.
